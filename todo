- Add a readme
- Add a license
- Use markdown for this todo list
- Add logging
- Figure out a good place to store the token
- Add exception handling (just some listener that sends embeds on errors)
- Find a better place for some utils (like Sendable, MultipageEmbed, etc.), also think about them more and rewrite them
- Make models that have an id field keep track of the id themselves (increment a static id variable in the constructor)
